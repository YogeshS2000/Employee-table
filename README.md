I have used Angular15.

steps followed

1.Created an service class to get the data from the API through observable.
2.Used the data from service file to component.ts and added the sorting logic to it.
3.Feeded the data to the html tables.

I have tryed to create the pie chart but due to some installation error of chart.js and other libraries and lack of time, I left that and commented out the pie chart code.

NOTE: Due to the inappropriate data (eg: Tim Perkinson start time: 2022-02-02 14:00  end time:2022-02-02 11:20) the total time is calculated as negative time.
